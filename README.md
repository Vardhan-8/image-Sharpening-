#Image sharpening using knowledge distillation
Image sharpening is a fundamental task in image processing aimed at enhancing the clarity and detail of images by emphasizing edges and fine features. Traditional methods, such as unsharp masking and high-pass filtering, often introduce artifacts or amplify noise, limiting their effectiveness in complex scenarios. Recent advances in deep learning have enabled more sophisticated approaches, leveraging neural networks to achieve superior sharpening results. However, deploying large, computationally intensive models on resource-constrained devices poses challenges. Knowledge distillation (KD) offers a solution by transferring knowledge from a large, high-performing teacher model to a smaller, efficient student model, maintaining performance while reducing computational demands.
Image sharpening enhances the visual quality of images by increasing the contrast of edges, making details more perceptible. Deep learning-based sharpening models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or generative adversarial networks (GANs), learn to map blurry or low-quality images to their sharp counterparts. However, these models are often large, requiring significant computational resources, which makes them impractical for deployment on mobile devices or edge systems.
#Methodology 
Teacher Model Training: A large, high-capacity teacher model (e.g., a deep CNN or a GAN-based architecture) is trained on a dataset of paired images (blurry and sharp). The teacher learns to map low-quality inputs to high-quality outputs, capturing fine details and edge information.
Student Model Design: A lightweight student model, with fewer layers or parameters, is designed to approximate the teacher’s performance. Architectures like MobileNet or a simplified CNN are often chosen for their efficiency.
{Ground Truth Loss}: A loss function (e.g., Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Perceptual Loss) compares the student’s output to the ground truth sharp images.
Distillation Loss}: A loss function measures the difference between the student’s output and the teacher’s output (soft targets) or intermediate feature maps. Common choices include Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence for soft outputs or MSE for feature map
Training Optimization: The student model is optimized using a weighted combination of ground truth and distillation losses, ensuring it learns both the true mapping and the teacher’s nuanced behavior.
Evaluation: The student model is evaluated on metrics such as Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and inference time to assess sharpening quality and efficiency.
